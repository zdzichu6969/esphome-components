## Configuration variables:
* **id** (*Optional*, [ID](https://esphome.io/guides/configuration-types.html#config-id)): Manually specify the ID used for code generation.
* **total** (**Required**, [ID](https://esphome.io/guides/configuration-types.html#config-id)): The ID of the total power sensor.
* **time_offset** (*Optional*, int): The number of seconds offset to synchronize with your mains time. Positive or negative. Defaults 0.
* **time_offset_service** (*Optional*, string): The name of service published to `Home Assistant`.
* **tariffs**: (**Required**, List): List of Tariff sensors. Minimum 1, maximum 4 (Let me know if you need more). See [Tariff Sensor](#Tariff_Sensor).
* **on_tariff** (*Optional*, Action): An automation to perform when the tariff was changed. See [energy_tariffs.on_tariff](#energy_tariffs.on_tariff).
* **on_before_tariff** (*Optional*, Action): An automation that will be performed one second ahead of the tariff change time. See [energy_tariffs.on_before_tariff](#energy_tariffs.on_before_tariff).

## Tariff Sensor
Provide energy consumption for specified time period.
> One tariff (usually peak) is required to be default (without time).

### Configuration variables:
* **time** (List): The list of time periods in `HH:MM-HH:MM` format.
* **service** (*Optional*, string): The name of service published to `Home Assistant`.
* Any options from [Sensor](https://esphome.io/components/sensor/index.html#config-sensor).

## Lambda calls
From [lambdas](https://esphome.io/guides/automations.html#config-lambda), you can call several methods to do some advanced stuff.

* **get_time_offset()**: You colud easly get configured time offset if you need it.
  ```yaml
  # Example configuration entry
  ...
  esphome:
    name: my_node
  ...
external_components:
  - source:
      type: git
      url: https://github.com/zdzichu6969/esphome_custom_components
    components: [ energy_tariffs ]
    refresh: 0s
  ...
  sensor:
    - platform: template
      id: time_offset
      name: "$name Time Offset"
      icon: mdi:clock-fast
      accuracy_decimals: 0
      unit_of_measurement: "s"
      lambda: |-
        return id(tariffs).get_time_offset();
  ```
  And display it in `Home Assistant`:
  ```yaml
  # Example HA configuration entry
  sensor:
    - platform: template
      sensors:
        my_node_time:
          friendly_name: "My Node Time"
          icon_template: mdi:clock-outline
          value_template: >-
            {{ (as_timestamp(now()) + states('sensor.my_node_time_offset')|int) | timestamp_custom("%H:%M:%S") }}
  ```
